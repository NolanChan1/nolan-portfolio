## Nolan Chan's Portfolio Website

This repository contains the source code for a portfolio website that I built for myself. This website was developed with Next.js and Tailwind CSS. In regards to website design, I aimed for a "business card" look/feel.

The icons used on this website were obtained from [Iconify](https://iconify.design/).

To run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```
