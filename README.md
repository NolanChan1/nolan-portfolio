## My Portfolio Website

This is a portfolio website that I have created for myself using Next.js (app directory) and Tailwind CSS. My goals for developing this website involve making myself try new things such as: developing with Tailwind CSS, and responsive website development. The icons used on this website were obtained from [Iconify](https://iconify.design/).

To run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

You can also view the deployed website [here]().

If you notice any bugs or issues with my code, I would appreciate it if you took the time to notify me! I am a junior developer, so I will appreciate any insights on how to improve my code.

### TODO:

- Improve website accessibility
- Look into website performance and SEO
